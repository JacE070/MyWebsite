        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I put all the projects I am working on/I've done on this page. By now, all of them (if work) are deployed in Github Pages (Thanks Github. Totally free is so kind).</p>
        <p>The page is simple, because I was heavily impressed by the look of my professors' personal websites, which are also simple, of nothing about color. So I decide to focus on the pure clarity of my website content, that greatly depends on structure and inner logic of the language.</p>

        <h2>0. Personal Website</h2>
        
        <p>Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
        <p>Description: This is my first personal website and should be the last done project ; ) I am eager to add anything important in my career (or life) to this place. Now my website is built by pure HTML, CSS, and JS without anything framework. I am expecting to learn and apply React framework on it then.</p>

        <h2>1. Employee Management System with GUI</h2>
        <p>Languages: Python3, MySQL</p>
        <p>Description: A simple software that use local MySQL database to add, update, and remove employee records. GUI is supported by Tkinter. This is the first project I tried to modify some features based on an existed project work. During the development, I also found out flaws that the original version has.</p>

        <p>Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
        <p>Description: A classic game that uses HTML5 canvas to implement simple graphics. Based on the original version of game, I added some new features like allowing players to change the theme and the moving speed of the ball.</p>
